    <h4>Our Goal</h4>
		<h6>The Traffic Prediction group is working to create an application that predicts dense road segments by using information that can be
		gained from a cell phone or other routing device, such as heading, destination, and location. Our prediction method attempts to be as
		accurate as possible by accounting for predicted dense areas when predicting dense areas further in the future. We also attempt to be as
		computationally efficient as possible by reducing the areas that are searched for dense roads by using dynamically sized cells. Having the
		knowledge of where roads are going to be busy and how busy they will be will allow drivers to plan their routes accordingly and avoid
		traffic saving both time and money. The phases of the traffic prediction algorithm can be found below.
