    <h4>S-STEM Scholarship</h4>
    <h6>
      The S-STEM scholarship program is designed to provide financial assistance and experiential learning opportunities to academically-talented
			students. The program offers students the opportunity to engage in enlightening research that enables them to learn about the research process, 
			expand their knowledge in an area they're interested in, and explore the possibilities of graduate school. Additionally, the program assists scholars 
			with obtaining internships and full-time employment. For more details about the program, contact Dr. Sedigh Sarvestani at
