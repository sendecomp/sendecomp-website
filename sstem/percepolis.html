    <h4>Our Goal</h4>
    <h6>
      The Percepolis project aims to design and create a web application that employs a set of algorithms to personalize and optimize a student's path
			to graduation. The algorithms automate and streamline the academic advising process, an area that has largely gone untouched through the rise
			of technology over the past two decades. The algorithms are designed to help the student tailor their college career and degree to their interests
			while also ensuring that they complete their degree quickly, but at a pace right for them. The application consists of four algorithms, each
			enumerated below. The repositories for the project can be found below, however access is required for viewing.

    <h4>Algorithms</h4>
		<ul>
			<li>Student Performance Evaluation</li>
				<ul>
					<li>Evaluates a student's past performance and calculates a suggested credit hour limit</li>
				</ul>
			<li>Course Selection and Optimization</li>
				<ul>
					<li>
						Selects courses based upon the student's degree requirements, career interests, and course availability. Once all courses in the
						path to graduation have been selected, the algorithm puts the courses into semesters in an optimized ordering that represents the
						fastest path to graduation.
					</li>
				</ul>
			<li>Course Scheduling</li>
				<ul>
					<li>
						Finds all possible schedules for a student for the upcoming semester. Once a schedule has been selected, the student is auto-enrolled,
						eliminating the need for the student to stress about enrollment times.
					</li>
				</ul>
			<li>Course Difficulty</li>
				<ul>
					<li>Evaluates a student's past performance and that of similar students to determine the probability that the student will pass a given course.</li>
				</ul>
