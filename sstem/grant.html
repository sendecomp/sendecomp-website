    <h4>About the Program</h4>
    <h6>
      The S-STEM program is designed to provide participating scholars with an opportunity to engage in research at Missouri S&amp;T. The program is funded by a grant from the National Science Foundation
			The program first started in 2019 with one project and has since grown to include three projects, each contributing to different research areas. There are now two cohorts of scholars, the first
			with six scholars and the second with eight scholars. Each of the three projects are listed with a brief description below, along with links to the project's page and the members of the project.
