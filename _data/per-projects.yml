- name: "Pervasive Cyberinfrastructure for Personalized eLearning and Instructional Support (PERCEPOLIS)"
  desc: "Advances in databases, distributed computing, computational intelligence, and especially pervasive computing, which allows non-intrusive and transparent “anytime, anywhere” access to information, provide fertile ground for radical changes in pedagogy. Recent studies of undergraduate engineering education have identified “linearity” of the dominant curricular model as fundamentally contradictory to the body of knowledge on how students learn. A networked model has been proposed, where the components form a cohesive and strongly interconnected whole, and learning in one area reinforces and supports learning in other areas. The objective of this project is to leverage technological advances, in particular in pervasive computing, to create a cyberinfrastructure that facilitates personalized learning in engineering education, while supporting a networked curricular model. We believe that such an infrastructure will accelerate the acquisition of knowledge and skills critical to professional engineering practice, while facilitating the study of how this acquisition comes about, yielding insights that may lead to significant changes in pedagogy."
