- name: "Quantitative Analysis of Cyber-Physical Systems: Reliability of the Smart Grid"
  desc: "The advanced electric power grid promises a self-healing infrastructure using distributed, coordinated, power electronics control. One promising power electronics device, the Flexible AC Transmission System (FACTS) device, can modify the power flow locally within a power grid. Embedded computers within the FACTS devices, along with the links connecting them, form a communication and control network that can dynamically change the advanced electric power grid to achieve higher dependability. The goal is to reroute power distribution in the event of transmission line failure. Such a system over a widespread area, is a cyber-physical system. The overall reliability of the advanced electric power grid is function of the respective reliabilities of its two major subsystems, namely, the FACTS network and the physical components that comprise the power grid.

The objective of this project is to develop a quantitative model for the reliability of the advanced electric power grid, taking into account interdependencies among the cyber and physical components of the grid, while reflecting the effect of interdependent line failures."

- name: "Agent-Based Analysis and Mitigation of Failure in Cyber-Physical Systems"
  desc: "Interdependencies among the cyber and physical components of a CPS significantly complicate the specification, modeling, and simulation of these systems, as it is difficult to represent both the cyber and the physical infrastructure in one integrated system. The interdependencies among the cyber and physical components and heterogeneity in the notion of \"flow\" invalidate and complicate traditional reliability models that assume components fail independently. We propose the use of agent-based modeling for qualitative representation of the operation of a CPS, as a precursor to quantitative modeling. Agent-based models can capture various facets of the operation of a CPS within a single agent, while reflecting the distributed nature of and interdependencies within the system through the use of multiple agents. Furthermore, such an abstraction facilitates failure mitigation through the use of software agents, which are autonomous and perceivably intelligent.

The overarching objective of this project is to develop an understanding of failure propagation in CPSs, and to utilize the resulting insights to mitigate the effect of failures in cyber and/or physical components. Our focus is on critical infrastructure systems whose main function is the distribution of a tangible commodity, such as water or power. Physical components, e.g., valves, pipes, and reservoirs, of water distribution networks (WDNs), coupled with the hardware and software that support intelligent water allocation, comprise the model CPS that is used as a case study."

- name: "Cyber-Physical System Model Transformation"
desc: "
Generating models for every aspect of a system is a labor-intensive and error-prone process.
My work focuses on defining transformations from one type of system model to a different type of model, allowing developers to derive models of various system aspects easily.
Initially I will focus on transforming system architecture models to non-functional attribute models; for example, transforming an architectural model of a power grid into a reliability model. 
Ultimately I will expand this work to arbitrary model transformations.
Any model that can be deterministically transformed must be deterministically specified; these deterministic specifications can be converted into abstract mathematical models. 
In this framework, transformations then become functions mapping one model to another. 
Formalizing modeling in this fashion allows us to apply a wealth of research on transforming mathematical structures."

- name: "The SmartBrick Wireless Sensor Platform for High-Resolution Structural Health Monitoring"
  desc: "This project encompasses the real-time monitoring, communications, and alerting capabilities of the Smart Brick, a low-cost, autonomous wireless device for structural health monitoring. It is a fully self-contained monitoring platform, requiring no additional on-site equipment to collect data and generate alerts. The Smart Brick has several sensors for monitoring temperature, water level, tilt, vibration, and acoustic emissions and can optionally be used with a digital camera, displacement sensors, load cells, strain gauges, or any number of other analog or digital sensors. It uses the widely-available GSM/GPRS network to send monitoring data and alerts to a number of users via FTP, SMS, and e-mail. Its rugged construction, completely wireless design, and extensive power-saving measures allow for a field life of 3-4 years powered only by alkaline batteries.

This project is being currently developed into Standoff detection of IED emplacement using non-imaging wireless sensor networks. This project involves monitoring the environment for phenomena indicative of IED emplacement, using seismic, acoustic, magnetic, infrared, and RF sensors, among others. Expandable I/O and plug-and-play software support will allow for additional sensors to be integrated as needed. The advantage of these modalities over techniques based on imaging is their autonomy and significantly lower cost. Signal processing and data fusion will be employed for corroboration of data from multiple sensors, resulting in higher probability of detection. Communication capability allows for corroboration with offsite databases, and facilitates autonomous transmission of alerts.Hardware and software of the base system has been designed with the goal of ultra-low power consumption, which in conjunction with the harvesting of solar power, remote configuration and update, and physical robustness, allows long extended field life of the system."

- name: "Software-Based Analysis of the Immunity of Embedded Systems to ESD"
  desc: "Electrostatic discharge (ESD) can be a source of significant delay in the development of embedded systems, as ESD problems are typically discovered very late in the development cycle. Electromagnetic aspects of ESD are well-studied, and insight has been gained into the coupling paths and induced noise voltages. However, the reaction of a product to ESD is not fully characterized by noise voltages, and also requires that disruptions to the software behavior be captured. Combining knowledge of the electromagnetic effects of ESD with sound understanding of the behavior of embedded software will allow use of the software as an ESD analysis tool. The objective of this project is to investigate the role of software in analyzing and improving the electromagnetic immunity of embedded systems. The resulting insights can be used to issue guidelines to software developers, reducing the likelihood of future disruptions to the software by ESD. Our broader goal is to develop a science that will link the traditionally disparate fields of electromagnetic and software engineering, by leveraging the body of knowledge in each field."
