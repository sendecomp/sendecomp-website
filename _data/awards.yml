# Awards Data File
# Description
#     This file contains individual records for SeNDeComp member awards.
#     Feel free to use an existing record as a starting point for a new entry.
#     Each individual record is denoted by ONLY ONE dash "-" on the first line.
#     After that, a list of attributes can be seen.
#     The name of the attribute is to the left of the colon; the value is to the
#       right of the colon.
#     The attributes available for each record are as follows:
#         name        Title of the award;*
#                       try to keep them consistent within each type

#         type        The type specifies a group under which to place this
#                       record - enter an existing value or make a new one
#         people      A list of members who received this award;

#      - Quotes around the values are optional, unless there exist a colon (:)
#           in the entry
#      - Non-required attributes with blank values can be ommitted completely
#      - For long entries, it is advised to use a block style: in front of the
#           key, add a ">" character, followed by as many indented lines as
#           needed,
#           e.g., - name: >
#                     This is a very very long entry that doesn't fit in a
#                     single line.
