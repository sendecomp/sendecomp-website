# Publications Data File
# Description
#     This file contains individual records for each publication published by
#       members of the group.
#     Feel free to use an existing record as a starting point for a new entry.
#     Each individual record is denoted by ONLY ONE dash "-" on the first line.
#     After that, a list of attributes can be seen.
#     The name of the attribute is to the left of the colon; the value is to the
#       right of the colon.
#     The attributes available for each record are as follows:
#         citation    The full MLA citation*
#         year        The year of publication*
#         status      The current status of the publication*
#                     Options: "To Appear" or "Under Review" or "Published"
#         awards      Some text denoted an award received for this publication
#         area        Specifying this will list the document in the appropriate
#                       research area*
#                     Options: "per" or "cip"
#         fulltext    The full URL to where the publication can be obtained
#         badge       The badge is an image that is displayed below the
#                       publication to denote something special
#                     The value should just be the name of the image file
#                       (must exist in the /img/badges/ directory)
#         badge-link  The full URL of wherever the user should be taken when
#                       clicking on a badge image
#      * Required in order for the website to display
#    Additional Notes:
#      - Quotes around the values are optional.
#      - Non-required attributes with blank values can be omitted completely.
