    Quantitative Analysis of Cyber-Physical Systems:
    Reliability of the Smart Grid
  desc: |
    The advanced electric power grid promises a self-healing infrastructure
    using distributed, coordinated, power electronics control.
    One promising power electronics device, the Flexible AC Transmission
    System (FACTS) device, can modify the power flow locally within a power
    grid.
    Embedded computers within the FACTS devices, along with the links
    connecting them, form a communication and control network that can
    dynamically change the advanced electric power grid to achieve higher
    dependability.
    The goal is to reroute power distribution in the event of transmission
    line failure.
    Such a system over a widespread area, is a cyber-physical system.
    The overall reliability of the advanced electric power grid is function
    of the respective reliabilities of its two major subsystems, namely,
    the FACTS network and the physical components that comprise the power
    grid.
    The objective of this project is to develop a quantitative model for the
    reliability of the advanced electric power grid, taking into account
    interdependencies among the cyber and physical components of the grid,
    while reflecting the effect of interdependent line failures.

- name: Agent-Based Analysis and Mitigation of Failure in Cyber-Physical Systems
  desc: |
    Interdependencies among the cyber and physical components of a CPS
    significantly complicate the specification, modeling, and simulation of
    these systems, as it is difficult to represent both the cyber and the
    physical infrastructure in one integrated system.
    The interdependencies among the cyber and physical components and
    heterogeneity in the notion of \"flow\" invalidate and complicate
    traditional reliability models that assume components fail independently.
    We propose the use of agent-based modeling for qualitative
    representation of the operation of a CPS, as a precursor to quantitative
    modeling.
    Agent-based models can capture various facets of the operation of a CPS
    within a single agent, while reflecting the distributed nature of and
    interdependencies within the system through the use of multiple agents.
    Furthermore, such an abstraction facilitates failure mitigation through
    the use of software agents, which are autonomous and perceivably
    intelligent.
    The overarching objective of this project is to develop an understanding
    of failure propagation in CPSs, and to utilize the resulting insights to
    mitigate the effect of failures in cyber and/or physical components.
    Our focus is on critical infrastructure systems whose main function is
    the distribution of a tangible commodity, such as water or power.
    Physical components, e.g., valves, pipes, and reservoirs, of water
    distribution networks (WDNs), coupled with the hardware and software
    that support intelligent water allocation, comprise the model CPS that
    is used as a case study.

- name: Cyber-Physical System Model Transformation
  desc: |
    Generating models for every aspect of a system is a labor-intensive and
    error-prone process.
    My work focuses on defining transformations from one type of system
    model to a different type of model, allowing developers to derive models
    of various system aspects easily.
    Initially I will focus on transforming system architecture models to
    non-functional attribute models; for example, transforming an
    architectural model of a power grid into a reliability model.
    Ultimately I will expand this work to arbitrary model transformations.
    Any model that can be deterministically transformed must be
    deterministically specified; these deterministic specifications can be
    converted into abstract mathematical models.
    In this framework, transformations then become functions mapping one
    model to another.
    Formalizing modeling in this fashion allows us to apply a wealth of
    research on transforming mathematical structures.

    The SmartBrick Wireless Sensor Platform for High-Resolution Structural
    Health Monitoring
  desc: |
    This project encompasses the real-time monitoring, communications, and
    alerting capabilities of the Smart Brick, a low-cost, autonomous
    wireless device for structural health monitoring.
    It is a fully self-contained monitoring platform, requiring no
    additional on-site equipment to collect data and generate alerts.
    The Smart Brick has several sensors for monitoring temperature, water
    level, tilt, vibration, and acoustic emissions and can optionally be
    used with a digital camera, displacement sensors, load cells,
    strain gauges, or any number of other analog or digital sensors.
    It uses the widely-available GSM/GPRS network to send monitoring data
    and alerts to a number of users via FTP, SMS, and e-mail.
    Its rugged construction, completely wireless design, and extensive
    power-saving measures allow for a field life of 3-4 years powered only
    by alkaline batteries.
    This project is being currently developed into Standoff detection of IED
    emplacement using non-imaging wireless sensor networks.
    This project involves monitoring the environment for phenomena
    indicative of IED emplacement, using seismic, acoustic, magnetic,
    infrared, and RF sensors, among others.
    Expandable I/O and plug-and-play software support will allow for
    additional sensors to be integrated as needed.
    The advantage of these modalities over techniques based on imaging is
    their autonomy and significantly lower cost.
    Signal processing and data fusion will be employed for corroboration of
    data from multiple sensors, resulting in higher probability of
    detection.
    Communication capability allows for corroboration with offsite
    databases, and facilitates autonomous transmission of alerts.
    Hardware and software of the base system has been designed with the goal
    of ultra-low power consumption, which in conjunction with the harvesting
    of solar power, remote configuration and update, and physical
    robustness, allows long extended field life of the system.

- name: Software-Based Analysis of the Immunity of Embedded Systems to ESD
  desc: |
    Electrostatic discharge (ESD) can be a source of significant delay in
    the development of embedded systems, as ESD problems are typically
    discovered very late in the development cycle.
    Electromagnetic aspects of ESD are well-studied, and insight has been
    gained into the coupling paths and induced noise voltages.
    However, the reaction of a product to ESD is not fully characterized by
    noise voltages, and also requires that disruptions to the software
    behavior be captured.
    Combining knowledge of the electromagnetic effects of ESD with sound
    understanding of the behavior of embedded software will allow use of the
    software as an ESD analysis tool.
    The objective of this project is to investigate the role of software in
    analyzing and improving the electromagnetic immunity of embedded
    systems.
    The resulting insights can be used to issue guidelines to software
    developers, reducing the likelihood of future disruptions to the
    software by ESD.
    Our broader goal is to develop a science that will link the
    traditionally disparate fields of electromagnetic and software
    engineering, by leveraging the body of knowledge in each field.

- name: "Pervasive Cyberinfrastructure for Personalized eLearning and Instructional Support (PERCEPOLIS)"
  desc: "Advances in databases, distributed computing, computational intelligence, and especially pervasive computing, which allows non-intrusive and transparent \"anytime, anywhere\" access to information, provide fertile ground for radical changes in pedagogy. Recent studies of undergraduate engineering education have identified \"linearity\" of the dominant curricular model as fundamentally contradictory to the body of knowledge on how students learn. A networked model has been proposed, where the components form a cohesive and strongly interconnected whole, and learning in one area reinforces and supports learning in other areas. The objective of this project is to leverage technological advances, in particular in pervasive computing, to create a cyberinfrastructure that facilitates personalized learning in engineering education, while supporting a networked curricular model. We believe that such an infrastructure will accelerate the acquisition of knowledge and skills critical to professional engineering practice, while facilitating the study of how this acquisition comes about, yielding insights that may lead to significant changes in pedagogy."
