# Venues Data File
# Description
#     This file contains individual records for SeNDeComp publication venues.
#     Feel free to use an existing record as a starting point for a new entry.
#     Each individual record is denoted by ONLY ONE dash "-" on the first line.
#     After that, a list of attributes can be seen.
#     The name of the attribute is to the left of the colon; the value is to the
#       right of the colon.
#     The attributes available for each record are as follows:
#         name        The name of the venue*
#         website     The full URL to the venue's website*
#         area        Specifying this will list the venue in the appropriate
#                       research area*
#                     Options: "per", "cpci", or "emb"
#         type        The type of publication (Journal, Conference, etc.)
#      * Required in order for the website to display
#    Additional Notes:
#      - Quotes around the values are optional, unless there exist a colon (:)
#           in the entry
#      - Non-required attributes with blank values can be ommitted completely.
